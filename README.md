## Requirements for installation
&emsp;Python 3 (Recommended version: >= 3.8)
  
&emsp;Pip
  
&emsp;[FastANI](https://github.com/ParBLiSS/FastANI)

## Installation procedure

1. Install [FastANI](https://github.com/ParBLiSS/FastANI) according the developer's instructions.

2. Install genome-mds with pip

&emsp;`pip install genome-mds`

Here is an installation example with [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/):

&emsp;Create a conda enviroment for genome-mds

&emsp;`conda create -n genome_mds_env python=3.8`

&emsp;Activate the environment

&emsp;`conda activate genome_mds_env`

&emsp;Install FastANI on the environment

&emsp;`conda install -c bioconda fastani`

&emsp;Install genome-mds

&emsp;`pip install genome-mds`

## Usage

**Run Genome-MDS**

Please type `genome-mds` on your terminal.

Then, Genome-MDS will open automatically in your browser.

If Genome-MDS does not open, type the localhost address (e.g. http://localhost:8501/) of the streamlit server displayed in your terminal into the address bar of your browser.

This tool is powered by the [streamlit app](https://streamlit.io/). You may be asked to enter your email address when you first start the program, but this is not mandatory.

**Exit Genome-MDS**

To exit Genome-MDS, type `Control-C` in your terminal.

If you use the conda environment for genome-mds, you may need to deactivate it.

`conda deactivate <your-env-name>`

**Optional Run**

Change the maximum limit size of file uploadling to 1GB (1024MB) and Run Genome-MDS.

`genome-mds -M 1024`

## Manual

**STEP0: Go to your working directory**

Go to your working directory. Genome-MDS will run under the working directory.

`cd your_working_directory`

and, then type `genome-mds`.


**STEP1: Set output prefix**

In the first screen, set the name of the output directory. The directories will be created automatically. This directory will contain intermediate files, downloaded arrays, etc. You can also load past runs by putting in the name of the directory you have run before.

</p>

**STEP2: Upload your genomes**

You should upload your (multiple) genome sequences. The format of the file should be FASTA; a single FASTA should contain only one organism's genome.It is OK to include contigs and plasmids in FASTA, but do not include genomes derived from more than one organism. Files can also be uploaded by drag and drop.ã€€

</p>

**STEP3: Download sequences**

This step is optional. If you don't need to download anything, select None.
You can automatically download the genomes you want to compare. This corresponds to the [Taxonomy ID](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi) of NCBI; please enter your email address and the desired Taxonomy ID to query NCBI. Genome-MDS will contact NCBI to get the list of genome sequences first, and you can choose any sequence you want from this list. The selected sequences will be automatically downloaded to the output directory by clicking the Download button.

</p>

**STEP4: Distance calculation**

In this step, the distances between the genomes are calculated. Here, you can optionally specify the k-mer of ANI calculation and the thread during the calculation. The maximum number of threads for the calculation will be changed according to your PC environment.

</p>

**STEP5: Interactive MDS**

When the distance calculation is finished, the MDS will be drawn automatically. This MDS can be operated interactively. You can also save the figure.

</p>

Interactive MDS allows you to select sequences automatically. This operation allows you to select only the genomes you are interested in. The selected sequences can be downloaded from the automatically generated links.
